  The objective of RATF has always been the knowledge to all, regardless of age or locality. We hit hard on the key about not having a better or newcomer on the team, we all have knowledge for specific areas and there is always someone who stands out for such things. The RATF has already had several members in and out and we believe that everyone is satisfied with the team, they had full use while they were here. Current members do their utmost and devote themselves to solving problems as well as challenges, such as teamwork. We have goals for events, lectures and pass the knowledge to everyone who wants, a team that started only with a publication of a group on Facebook, is becoming one of the biggest teams to capture the flag of Brazil. I have so much to thank Roadsec (a special thanks to Anderson Ramos), who has always supported RATF from the start, and helped in a way to bring together this great team.
   We will continue our activities in pursuit of our goals, we believe that the way to date has been just the beginning, and that we can walk our paths together to achieve our great goal. The RATF will not stop, we will continue until the end making history in the world of the CTF.
